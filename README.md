# Chimera Model For Covid19

In this repository, we present the necessary codes and results to perform a validation (Sensitivity, uncertainty, and identifiability analyses) and parameter estimation of the CHIMERA discrete-type model using the [GSUA_CSB toolbox](https://github.com/drojasd/GSUA-CSB) in Matlab2020a. Also, we used as a study case the COVID-19 real data from two localities: Hubei-China (from January 21 to April 8, 2020) and Colombia (from March 6 to November 11).

In the notebook [1](https://alexacl95.github.io/ChimeraModelForCovid19/HTML/GeneralSA.html), we present the sensitivity analysis for the general model, i.e., using the estimation intervals defined for the model.
In notebooks [2](https://alexacl95.github.io/ChimeraModelForCovid19/HTML/ChinaValidation.html) and [3](https://alexacl95.github.io/ChimeraModelForCovid19/HTML/ColombiaValidation.html), we present the parameter estimations (model fitting) for Hubei and Colombia, respectively. Following the structure proposed in those codes, the codes could be implemented for other data and localities. 
In notebook [3](https://alexacl95.github.io/ChimeraModelForCovid19/HTML/Discussion.html) we summarize the results and perform a discussion.
